Apart from this my work at Fx Data labs have been featured twice in OpenReview conferences where we invented our algorithm h+Tree used to deliver 300% faster speed compared to existing B+Tree servers eventually reducing server cost significantly. Moreover through HTree plus platform we aim to challenge the existing infrastructure limit of databases by serving more number of users at once than ever imagined before!
