We have worked on many common projects and I can say this for sure that he is one of the best people I have worked with. His approach towards solving a problem is very unique and he is always ready to go out of his way to help anyone. He is a team player and he always leads from the front. He was hired as front-end developer which he specialises in and is a master at it but due to his nature of exploring and implementing new stuff he has worked on back-end in Ruby on Rails and Devops related tasks with equal proficiency..\n\nHe is a great mentor and I can say this as I have seen him mentoring a few(including me).\n\nHis architectural knowledge and software design principle skills make him a perfect match for any senior software development roles and I am sure he will go a long way.",
                    "Sudhanshu Yadav\n\n\n\nQuality code is something that comes to my mind when I think of Progyan. \n\nI had a pleasure working with him for ~2.5 years at HackerRank. And during this period, I have seen him continuously putting effort into improving the quality of code across the products. Whatever he touches he makes it elegant. He is Midas for code quality. He explores a lot on different architectures, system designs, patterns and engineering practices and tries to bring those learnings to the team and work he is doing.\n\nI will any day recommend Progyan for building a quality product and team.",
