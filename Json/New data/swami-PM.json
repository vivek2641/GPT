        "summary": "I love building things!\n\nA long time ago, I sat next to a friend who was writing a basic program in C. I watched her write lines of code, looking at mysterious compiler messages, and finally, a console that took my name as an input and returned a message \"Hello Swami!!!\". I was in absolute awe at this, by just typing in a few funny little symbols, limited only by imagination and ingenuity, I could build absolutely anything! I latched onto any projects I could find, going from a simple Hello World to a share predicting systems or even a strategy game! \n\nThis passion for building things has carried me throughout my education at XLRI, in the industry, and in pretty much everything I do. Building strategies, frameworks and action plans are just as exciting. Taking the various parts of a project and stakeholders and one l putting them together in a structured, meaningful manner is how I approach most of the challenging problems in my life. \n\nOwning a product or an strategy, conceptualizing it, innovating around it, molding and shaping it, watching it grow into something amazing is one of the best feelings ever.\n\nWhen I'm not formulating roadmaps or designing architectures, I am setting the kitchen aflame with my pizzas (mostly burning them), reading works of fiction, constantly learning about new innovations in technology, or watching re-runs of The Office.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out for absolutely anything under the sun, especially if you're a bit lost and need some support.",
